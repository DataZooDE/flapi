Content negotiation (Accept header, query param, quality values)\n2. Arrow stream validity (valid IPC format, correct schema)\n3. Empty result handling\n4. Data integrity (Arrow matches JSON)\n5. Client disconnect cleanup\n\n### Failed Tests (Server Hang Issue)\nAll failures are 60s timeouts - server stops responding:\n- Null value handling\n- Various data types\n- All compression tests (ZSTD, LZ4)\n- Memory bounds tests\n- Error handling tests\n- Performance tests\n\n### Root Cause\nServer hangs after handling certain Arrow requests. This appears related to the 'double HTTP response' issue identified earlier in development. The server becomes unresponsive to new requests.\n\n### Conclusion\n**PyArrow can successfully read flapi Arrow streams** when the server responds. The serialization format is correct.
