# MCP TOOL EXAMPLE
# ====================================================================================
# Pure MCP tool using shared configuration components
# Demonstrates how MCP tools can reuse REST endpoint configurations

# MCP tool definition
mcp-tool:
  name: customer_lookup
  description: Retrieve customer information by ID, segment, or other criteria
  result_mime_type: application/json

# Include shared request parameters (same as REST endpoint)
{{include:request from customer-common.yaml}}

# Include shared authentication (AI users can access this tool)
{{include:auth from customer-common.yaml}}

# Include shared rate limiting (may want different limits for AI tools)
{{include:rate-limit from customer-common.yaml}}

# Include shared connection and template
{{include:connection from customer-common.yaml}}
{{include:template-source from customer-common.yaml}}

# MCP-specific configuration
# Note: MCP tools typically don't need pagination as they're used programmatically
