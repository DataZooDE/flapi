# MCP RESOURCE EXAMPLE
# ====================================================================================
# This demonstrates how to create MCP resources (static content) using the unified approach

mcp-resource:
  name: customer_schema
  description: Customer database schema definition
  mime_type: application/json

# SQL that generates the resource content
template-source: customer-schema.sql
connection: [customers-parquet]

# Resources typically don't need request parameters, rate limiting, or auth
# But they can be added if needed for dynamic resource generation
