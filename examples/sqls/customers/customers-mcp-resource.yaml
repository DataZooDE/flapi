# ====================================================================================
# MCP RESOURCE EXAMPLE
# ====================================================================================
# MCP resource providing schema information about customer data
# Resources typically provide static or semi-static information

# MCP resource definition
mcp-resource:
  name: customer_schema
  description: Customer database schema definition and field descriptions
  mime-type: application/json

# Resources typically don't need request parameters, but can have them for dynamic content
# For this example, we'll make it static (no request parameters)

# Use dedicated SQL template for schema generation
template-source: customer-mcp-resource-schema.sql

# Include shared connection
{{include:connection from customer-common.yaml}}

# Resources typically don't need authentication, rate limiting, or caching
# But they can be added if the resource contains sensitive information
# {{include:auth from customer-common.yaml if env.SECURE_RESOURCES}}

# Optional: Light rate limiting to prevent abuse
rate-limit:
  enabled: true
  max: 10
  interval: 60  # Schema doesn't change often, so lower limits are fine
